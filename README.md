# Advanced-Lab-Radiation-Data
Creates 3D graphs of data gathered by exposing a raditation detector to varrying thickness of two different shielding materials (lead and aluminum)



How to use:

To print all of the graphs, simply run plotFinalGraphs() in the terminal.






How to interpret the data:

The goal of this experiment was to determine how varying amounts of radiation shielding block ionizing radiation. To do so radioactive samples were exposed to a detector for known amounts of time, with varrying amounts of shielding placed between the two. 
By charting this data in 3D we are able to gain a remarkably clear view of the relationship between thickness of shielding and measured radiation.
Each line represents a single source with a single thickness of shielding. These lines are a measurement of how many particles were detected at discrete energy levels, something that should be relatively constant for a pure sample such as the one in this test.
We then plot each of these energy spectra along a 3rd axis, acording to the thickness of the shielding.
This reveals the logarithmic nature of the effacasy of radiation shielding: initially the drop in measured particels is precipitous, however as time goes on, it levels out, and approaches an asymptote.
